This code snippet defines several functions for handling CRUD operations on products. Here's a breakdown of each function:

1. `getProducts`: Retrieves all products from the database using `Product.find({})` and returns them as a JSON response with status 200.

2. `getProduct`: Retrieves a single product based on the provided ID from the request parameters. It uses `Product.findById(id)` to find the product and returns it as a JSON response with status 200.

3. `createProduct`: Creates a new product in the database using the data from the request body with `Product.create(req.body)` and returns the created product as a JSON response with status 200.

4. `updateProduct`: Updates an existing product based on the provided ID from the request parameters. It uses `Product.findByIdAndUpdate(id, req.body)` to update the product and returns the updated product as a JSON response with status 200. If the product is not found, it returns a 404 status with an error message.

5. `deleteProduct`: Deletes a product based on the provided ID from the request parameters using `Product.findByIdAndDelete(id)`. If the product is not found, it returns a 404 status with an error message. Otherwise, it returns the deleted product as a JSON response with status 200.

Each function is wrapped in `asyncHandler` to handle asynchronous operations and errors. If an error occurs during the execution of any operation, it responds with a status of 500 and throws an error message.

The module exports these functions to be used in other parts of the application for handling product-related operations.
