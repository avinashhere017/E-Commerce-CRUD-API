This code is a Node.js application that sets up an API using Express, connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, and includes error handling middleware. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

1. Loads environment variables from a .env file using `dotenv` package.
2. Requires necessary dependencies: `express`, `errorMiddleware`, `mongoose`, `cors`.
3. Creates an Express application instance.
4. Defines a variable `productRoute` that requires a file containing routes related to products.
5. Sets up CORS configuration to allow requests from a specific frontend URL.
6. Parses incoming requests with JSON and URL-encoded payloads.
7. Defines routes for the root path ('/') and '/blog'.
8. Includes error handling middleware.
9. Connects to a MongoDB database using the MONGO_URL environment variable.
10. Starts the Express server to listen on the specified PORT or default to 3000.

Overall, this code initializes an Express server, sets up routes for '/' and '/blog', connects to a MongoDB database, and includes CORS configuration and error handling middleware.
