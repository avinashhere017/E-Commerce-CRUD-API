This code defines a functional component called CreatePage in a React application. Here's a concise explanation of what the code does:

Import necessary dependencies:

useState from React for managing state in functional components.
axios for making HTTP requests.
useNavigate from React Router for navigating to different routes.
toast from react-toastify for displaying toast messages.
VITE_BACKEND_URL from the App component for the backend URL.
Define state variables using the useState hook:

name, quantity, price, image: for storing product information.
isLoading: for managing loading state.
Define a function saveProduct:

It is an asynchronous function that handles form submission.
It validates the input fields and displays an alert if any field is empty.
It makes a POST request to the backend API to save the product information.
It displays a success message using toast if the request is successful, otherwise displays an error message.
Render a form inside a styled <div> element:

The form contains input fields for name, quantity, price, and image URL.
Input fields are controlled components, updating the state on change.
The form submission is handled by the saveProduct function.
A button to save the product is rendered conditionally based on the loading state.
Export the CreatePage component as the default export.

Overall, this code sets up a form for creating a product with fields for name, quantity, price, and image URL. When the form is submitted, the product data is sent to a backend API, and appropriate messages are displayed based on the response.
